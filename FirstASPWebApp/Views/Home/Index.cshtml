        Superman… Spiderman… and Cosmo… the mystery behind the mask. Through two obscured eye openings, it was thrilling to see expressions of excitement and amazement. I could make thousands of people’s day with a simple high five, acrobatic stunt or photo opp. But in reality, becoming Cosmo the Cougar, BYU’s beloved mascot, was actually more coincidental than heroic. As an adrenaline junkie, my reputation as a cliff jumper and snowboard flipper preceded me since people apparently like to watch and share stupid human tricks! As my following grew, the recruiter of the university mascot and dunk team stumbled upon one video and messaged me if I wanted to join like-minded thrillseekers to create amazing feats during athletic competitions and campus events. This seemed like a natural fit with my desire to push the limits of my own physical and acrobatic ability. As I jumped in and integrated with the team, our goal grew from simply generating in-game applause to delivering original short-form content that would enhance our school brand and grow our teams’ fanbase. Burning batons, cameo dances and progressive push-ups to the top of a folding table tower were among many unique ideas I helped to create. In a couple short years, most YouTube and social media clips of Cosmo have generated millions of views and have gone viral to new audiences through talk shows, news media, and even SportsCenter Top 10’s. Recently, Cosmo’s increased popularity and recognition earned us the title as NCAA’s top ranked mascot. While this was a fun accomplishment, our impact didn’t end there: we realized that Cosmo’s influence could also be localized for meaningful purposes. Each week, we dedicate hours to travel and connect with people across various schools, charities and fundraising events. Since Cosmo’s identity is sworn to secrecy (I couldn’t even tell my parents or roommates), these anonymous acts of kindness taught me that I genuinely loved serving and uplifting others not because they promoted me personally but rather for the benefit of others. This has added a new dimension to my life as I feel grateful and motivated to spread kindness and champion the underdog to accomplish their dreams. Turns out that being a superhero is pretty super for the hero too.

        As an adrenaline junkie, flipping and twisting mid-air and 70 feet above water is something I was born for…and a natural fit with the BYU Cosmo and Dunk team. This was such a fun way to do exciting things, promote the university and serve the community whether at sporting events or charitable visits at the hospital. After one too many trampoline bounces, I woke up one morning with tingling pains and debilitating aches down my back and legs that ironically sent me to the hospital with two bulging discs. Whereas just prior, I was in full stride with physical and academic goals, my work to become an elite athlete was met with an inability to tie my own shoes. I felt discouraged and hopeless as doctors predicted a new life of limitations. My nightly Hail Mary’s that I’d wake up pain-free the next day were fruitless. The energetic and dynamic life-style I had lived meant everything to me, and I was being told those days were in the past. Instead of accepting this as reality, I dug deep and committed to ten months of intense physical therapy to persevere through pain, thrive in the face of adversity and regain my health. This defining journey has taught me invaluable lessons of resilience, perspective to my identity and purpose and insight to others’ challenges. I am grateful for this trial, as what I have learned and who I have become is far greater than the challenge itself.
